This is a simple linear regression model to predit the CO2 emmission from cars
Dataset:
FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions
for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada

# take a look at the dataset
#df.head()

#use required features
cdf = df[['ENGINESIZE','CYLINDERS','FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB','CO2EMISSIONS']]

#Training Data and Predictor Variable
# Use all data for training (tarin-test-split not used)
x = cdf.iloc[:, :3]
y = cdf.iloc[:, -1]

#Fitting model with trainig data

# Saving model to disk
# Pickle serializes objects so they can be saved to a file, and loaded in a program again later on.

#Loading model to compare the results
