# Electricity_Demand_Management

This project, developed by Pirate-Emperor, focuses on managing electricity demand during peak periods using machine learning (ML) models for forecasting and optimization.

## Features

- **Load Forecasting**: Uses historical electricity consumption data to predict future load using ML models.
- **Demand Response**: Implements demand response strategies to shift or shed load during peak times.
- **Optimization**: Applies optimization techniques to reduce peak demand and distribute loads evenly.
- **Cost Savings**: Offers solutions to minimize electricity costs during peak hours.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive dashboard for easy monitoring and decision-making.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Electricity_Demand_Management.git
cd Electricity_Demand_Management
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will use historical electricity consumption data to train the ML models and predict future load. It will also apply demand response strategies and optimization techniques to manage electricity demand during peak hours.

## Data Source

The project requires historical electricity consumption data with time-series information, such as date, time, and electricity consumption. You can obtain the data from public datasets or your local utility provider.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Python scripts in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Exploring more sophisticated ML models for load forecasting.
- Enhancing the demand response strategies for better load management.
- Integrating weather forecasts and other external factors for improved predictions.
- Improving the user experience of the dashboard.
